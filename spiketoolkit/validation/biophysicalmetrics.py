'''
This module implements a number of biophysical metrics to validate spike sorting
results.

def getISIRatio(sorting, sampling_frequency, unit_ids=None, save_as_property=True):
    '''This function calculates the ratio between the frequency of spikes present
    within 0- to 2-ms (refractory period) interspike interval (ISI) and those at 0- to 20-ms
    interval. It then returns the ratios and also adds a property, ISI_ratio, for
    the passed in sorting extractor. Taken from:

     "Large-scale, high-density (up to 512 channels) recording of local circuits
     in behaving animals" - Antal Ber√©nyi, et al.

    Parameters
    ----------
    unit_ids: list
        List of unit ids for which to get ISIratios
    sorting: SortingExtractor
        SortingExtractor for the results file being analyzed
    sampling_frequency: float
        The sampling frequency of recording
    save_as_property: boolean
        If True, this will save the ISI_ratio as a property in the given
        sorting extractor.

    Returns
    ----------
    ISI_ratios: list of floats
        A list of ratios for each unit passed into this function. Each ratio is
        the ratio between the frequency of spikes present within 0- to 2-ms ISI
        and those at 0- to 20-ms interval for the corresponding spike train.
